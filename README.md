# The Course Forum Sentiment Analyzer

Welcome to my web scraper/sentiment analyzer (using Roberta models and importing from transformers)!

I recommend going from:

1. sentiment_analysis.ipynb
2. courseForumWebscrape.ipynb
3. generalizing_TCF_sentiment_analysis.ipynb

to understand the flow of learning from basic sentiment analysis tutorial on Amazon reviews of oatmeal, to scraping the Course Forum (TCF) and some preliminary analysis on CSO1, to generalizing that sentiment analysis on all TCF links.

Happy learning!<br>
